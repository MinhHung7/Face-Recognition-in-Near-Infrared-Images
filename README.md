## 👉 Here are some information about this project
The first, we sincerely express our gratitude to [Avshet and his team](https://github.com/avshet/Face-recognition-in-Near-InfraRed-images) for giving us hints and ways to solve this problem
In this project, we perform data augmentation techniques, face-features extraction with vggello there 🖐

The first, we sincerely express our gratitude to [Avshet and his team](https://github.com/avshet/Face-recognition-in-Near-InfraRed-images) for giving us hints and ways to solve this problem
In this project, we perform data augmentation techniques, face-features extraction with vgg_face, then build a model by tensorflow for 16 faces recognition in NIR images. In inference stage, we use yolo_face to detect faces from NIR images, then use us model to recognize them
## 👉 How to run
First, you need to clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/MinhHung7/Face-Recognition-in-Near-Infrared-Images
```
Then download the dataset from here: [TD_NIR_A_Set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rhibpEo5T-HecraUNpsAqDpUD4MNBZPl/view?usp=drive_link)

Ok, now you just need to run recognition.ipynb in recognition folder
